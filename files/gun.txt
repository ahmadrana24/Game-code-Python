Sherlock soon deduces the cabbie is an estranged father who was told 3 years earlier he was dying. 
The cabbie admits that a "fan" of Sherlock's contacted him and offered to "sponsor" his work, paying 
money for each murder, to be left to the cabbie's children. Sherlock realises the gun is actually a 
novelty cigarette lighter and starts to leave. However, the cabbie challenges him again to choose a 
pill and see if he can solve the puzzle. Meanwhile, John traced the GPS signal from the phone and followed 
Sherlock. Through a window in the adjacent building he shoots the cabbie. Sherlock questions the dying cabbie 
about the identity of his "fan", the cabbie's sponsor, and finally, under duress, he reveals a name: "Moriarty".
