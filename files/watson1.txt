Watson : Sherlock what are we going to do with this bag ?
Sherlock : What do you think we are going to do with it ?
Watson : Umm! search for a clue or somthing like that right?
Sherlock : Yea ofcourse.
Watson : Sherlock can we eat something? I'm starving. There are plenty of famous 
         hotels in this street.
