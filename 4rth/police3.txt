EVENING/NIGHT TIME. NEW SCOTLAND YARD. Sherlock walks into the main office brandishing a folder at Lestrade. 
SHERLOCK: Raoul de Santos is your killer. Kenny Prince’s houseboy. Second autopsy shows it wasn’t tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince – it was botulinum toxin. 
(He puts the folder on the desk. As Lestrade reaches for it, Sherlock leans closer to him.) 
SHERLOCK: We’ve been here before. Carl Powers? Tut-tut. Our bomber’s repeated himself. 
(Lestrade walks towards his office, Sherlock following. John stares at them in surprise.) 
LESTRADE: So how’d he do it? 
SHERLOCK: Botox injection. 
(Flashback to Sherlock examining the tiny pinpricks in Connie’s forehead.) 
LESTRADE (turning back to him): Botox? 
SHERLOCK: Botox is a diluted form of botulinum. Among other things, Raoul de Santos 
was employed to give Connie her regular facial injections. My contact at the Home Office gave me 
the complete records of Raoul’s internet purchases. (He points to the folder.) He’s been bulk ordering Botox for months. 
(Nearby, John has continued to stare at Sherlock, and his expression is becoming more angry.) 
SHERLOCK (oblivious to this): Bided his time, then upped the strength to a fatal dose. 
LESTRADE: You sure about this? 
SHERLOCK: I’m sure. 
LESTRADE: All right – my office.
