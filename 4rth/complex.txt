SWIMMING POOL. Sherlock opens a door leading into the area surrounding an indoor swimming 
pool. The lights are on but there is nobody visible in the area. Somewhere between Baker Street and 
here, he has taken off his Coat and is just wearing his suit, so presumably the heating is on as well. He 
walks slowly towards the shallow end of the pool, probably very aware that the upper gallery where 
people sit and watch the swimmers is still in darkness. He stops at the edge of the pool and turns, trying 
to see up into the viewing gallery. Finally he turns towards the pool again, raising one hand and holding up the memory stick. 
SHERLOCK (loudly): Brought you a little getting-to-know-you present. Oh, that’s what it’s all been for, 
hasn’t it? All your little puzzles; making me dance – all to distract me from this. 
(He gestures with the memory stick, then begins to turn in a slow circle while he waits for a response. 
When his back is turned to the pool, a door opens halfway down the room. Sherlock looks over his 
shoulder, still holding the memory stick aloft. And John Watson walks through the door and into 
the pool area, wrapped snugly in a hooded jacket with his hands tucked into the pockets. He turns 
and looks at Sherlock as the detective stares back at him in absolute shock.) 
JOHN: Evening. 
(Sherlock’s raised hand begins to lower slowly but otherwise he doesn’t move, still staring over his shoulder in utter disbelief.) 
JOHN: This is a turn-up, isn’t it, Sherlock? 
SHERLOCK (softly, shocked): John. What the hell ...? 
JOHN: Bet you never saw this coming.
