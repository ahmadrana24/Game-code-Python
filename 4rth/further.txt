SHERLOCK: Can’t be as simple as it seems, otherwise the bomber wouldn’t be 
directing us towards it. Something’s wrong. 
(He narrows his eyes as he looks down at the body, then bends closer to look along 
Connie’s right arm as he takes his magnifier from his pocket. There are several scratches 
on her upper arm which look like claw marks. He moves up to her face and notices some 
tiny pinpricks on her forehead just above her nose. He looks at them through the magnifier.) 
SHERLOCK: John? 
JOHN: Mmm. 
SHERLOCK: The cut on her hand: it’s deep; would have bled a lot, right? 
JOHN: Yeah. 
SHERLOCK: But the wound’s clean – very clean, and fresh.
