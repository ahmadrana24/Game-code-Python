SHERLOCK: Not any more. So: dead two days. According to one of her staff, Raoul de Santos, 
she cut her hand on a rusty nail in the garden. Nasty wound. 
(He and John look at the deep cut in the webbing between her right thumb and index finger.) 
SHERLOCK: Tetanus bacteria enters the bloodstream – good night Vienna. 
JOHN: I suppose. 
SHERLOCK: Something’s wrong with this picture. 
LESTRADE: Eh?
