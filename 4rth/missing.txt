LESTRADE: Yes. Why is he doing this, the bomber? 
(Sherlock stops, keeping his back to the inspector and looking a little anxious.) 
LESTRADE: If this woman’s death was suspicious, why point it out? 
SHERLOCK (nonchalantly, over his shoulder): Good Samaritan. 
(He tries to move away but Lestrade persists.) 
LESTRADE: ... who press-gangs suicide bombers? 
SHERLOCK: Bad Samaritan. 
LESTRADE: I’m – I’m serious, Sherlock. Listen: I’m cutting you slack here; I’m trusting 
you – but out there somewhere, some poor bastard’s covered in Semtex and is just 
waiting for you to solve the puzzle. So just tell me: what are we dealing with? 
(Sherlock looks away thoughtfully, then smiles with delight.) 
SHERLOCK: Something new. 

EIGHT HOURS TO GO. The old woman sits quietly in her bed while the sniper – who must 
really love his job, considering that the woman can’t see what he’s doing – continues to 
keep his rifle’s laser trained on her.
