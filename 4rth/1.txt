MORNING. The boys are sitting opposite each other at a table in a café (not Speedy’s). John is tucking into 
a cooked breakfast and has a mug of tea in front of him while Sherlock is drumming his fingers impatiently 
on the table waiting for the pink phone – which is lying on the table – to ring. 
SHERLOCK: Feeling better? 
JOHN: Mmm. You realise we’ve hardly stopped for breath since this thing started?
