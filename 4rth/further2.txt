(He looks up, his eyes flickering while he thinks it through, then straightens up and clicks the 
magnifier closed.) 
SHERLOCK: How long would the bacteria have been incubating inside her? 
JOHN: Eight, ten days. 
(Sherlock quirks a one-sided grin and turns to John, waiting for him to put it all together. 
It doesn’t take him long.) 
JOHN: The cut was made later. 
LESTRADE: After she was dead? 
SHERLOCK: Must have been. The only question is, how did the tetanus enter the dead woman’s system? 
(John looks along the body thoughtfully.) 
SHERLOCK: You want to help, right? 
JOHN: Of course. 
SHERLOCK: Connie Prince’s background – family history, everything. Give me data. 
JOHN: Right. 
(He turns and leaves the room. Sherlock looks down at Connie’s body one more time, then turns 
and heads towards the door.) 
LESTRADE: There’s something else that we haven’t thought of.
