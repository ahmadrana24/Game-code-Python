JOHN (stopping and turning to him): No, wait, wait. Wait a second. 
(Sherlock stops as well.) 
JOHN: What about the disinfectant, then, on the cat’s claws? 
SHERLOCK: Raoul keeps a very clean house. You came through the kitchen 
door, saw the state of that floor, scrubbed to within an inch of its life. You 
smell of disinfectant now. No, the cat doesn’t come into it. 
(John pulls his jacket up to sniff at it as Sherlock looks towards the main road.) 
SHERLOCK: Raoul’s internet records do, though. Hope we can get a cab from here. 
(He walks off. John sighs in exasperation and a touch of disappointment that he 
hadn’t solved the case for once. He glares towards his friend’s back and then follows him.) 

ONE HOUR TO GO. Still sitting in her bed, the old woman cries in despair.
