(He turns and walks towards his office. Sherlock starts to follow but John stops him.) 
JOHN: Hey, Sherlock. How long? 
SHERLOCK: What? 
JOHN: How long have you known? 
SHERLOCK: Well, this one was quite simple, actually, and like I said, the bomber repeated himself. That was a mistake. 
(He tries to walk towards Lestrade’s office but again John stops him.) 
JOHN: No, but Sherl... The hostage... the old woman. She’s been there all this time. 
SHERLOCK (leaning closer and looking at him intensely): I knew I could save her. I also knew that the bomber had given us 
twelve hours. I solved the case quickly; that gave me time to get on with other things. Don’t you see? We’re one up on him! 
(He heads into Lestrade’s office. John purses his lips in frustration, then follows.) 

Shortly afterwards, Sherlock is sitting at Lestrade’s desk where a laptop has been opened to The Science of 
Deduction website. John and Lestrade are standing either side of him. Sherlock types into the message box: 

Raoul de Santos, the house-boy, botox.
