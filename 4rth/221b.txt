SEVERAL HOURS LATER. 221B. The wall behind the sofa is covered with paperwork: 
maps, photographs of Connie Prince – both when she was alive and pictures taken 
in the morgue – photos of Carl Powers, press cuttings and various sheets of paper 
with notes scribbled on them. Pieces of string are pinned between some of the 
exhibits, linking them together. Sherlock is pacing back and forth in front of the 
sofa while Lestrade stands nearby.
