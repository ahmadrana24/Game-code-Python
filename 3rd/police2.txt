SHERLOCK: Exactly. 
JOHN: Mmm. 
SHERLOCK (to Lestrade): They provide a very special service. If you’ve got any kind of a problem – money 
troubles, bad marriage, whatever – Janus Cars will help you disappear. Ian Monkford was up to his eyes in 
some kind of trouble – financial, at a guess; he’s a banker. Couldn’t see a way out. But if he were to vanish, 
if the car he hired was found abandoned with his blood all over the driver’s seat ... 
JOHN: So where is he? 
SHERLOCK (closing the car door): Colombia. 
LESTRADE: Colombia?!
