(John looks away, trying somewhat unsuccessfully to keep his face neutral.) 
SHERLOCK: I mean, I just can’t believe it. I only saw him the other day. Same 
old Ian – not a care in the world. 
(He smiles tearfully at her.) 
MRS MONKFORD: Sorry, but my husband has been depressed for months. Who are you? 
(By now Sherlock has tears running down his cheeks.) 
SHERLOCK: Really strange that he hired a car. Why would he do that? It’s a bit suspicious, isn’t it? 
MRS MONKFORD: No, it isn’t. He forgot to renew the tax on the car, that’s all. 
SHERLOCK: Oh, well, that was Ian! That was Ian all over! 
MRS MONKFORD: No it wasn’t. 
(Instantly Sherlock’s fake persona drops and he looks at her intensely.) 
SHERLOCK: Wasn’t it? Interesting. 
(He turns and walks away. She glares after him as he heads for the police tape with John following. 
The female police office goes over to her.)
