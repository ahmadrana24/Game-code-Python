LESTRADE: Before you ask, yes, it’s Monkford’s blood. The DNA checks out. 
(Sherlock finds a business card in the glove box and takes it out. Closing the lid he straightens up.) 
SHERLOCK: No body. 
DONOVAN: Not yet. 
SHERLOCK (to Lestrade): Get a sample sent to the lab. 
(Lestrade nods and Sherlock walks away. Lestrade turns to Donovan and looks at her 
pointedly. She stares back at him indignantly but he holds the look and she grunts in exasperation 
and stomps away. Sherlock walks over to the woman who was talking with the police officer.)
