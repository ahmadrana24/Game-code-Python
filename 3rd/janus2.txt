then turns away and heads around the room towards the other side of the desk.) 
JOHN: But you didn’t know Mr Monkford? 
EWERT: No, he was just a client. Came in here and hired one of my cars. No idea what happened to him. Poor sod. 
(Sherlock has reached the other side of the desk and stops.) 
SHERLOCK: Nice holiday, Mr Ewert? 
EWERT: Eh? 
SHERLOCK: You’ve been away, haven’t you? 
EWERT: Oh, the-the ... (He gestures towards his tanned face.) No, it’s, er, sunbeds, I’m afraid, yeah. Too 
busy to get away. My wife would love it, though – bit of sun. 
SHERLOCK: Have you got any change for the cigarette machine? 
EWERT: What? 
SHERLOCK: Well, I noticed one on the way in and I haven’t got any change. 
(He offers Ewert a bank note.) 
SHERLOCK: I’m gasping. 
EWERT: Um, well ... (He reaches into his trouser pocket and takes out his wallet.) Hmm. 
(He opens the wallet and looks inside.) 
EWERT: No, sorry. 
SHERLOCK: Oh well. Thank you very much for your time, Mr Ewert. 
(He turns and heads for the door.) 
SHERLOCK: You’ve been very helpful. Come on, John. 
(They leave the office and walk across the forecourt.)
