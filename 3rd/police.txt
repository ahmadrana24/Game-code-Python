POLICE CAR POUND. Sherlock, John and Lestrade are standing around Monkford’s car. 
SHERLOCK: How much blood was on that seat, would you say? 
LESTRADE: How much? About a pint. 
SHERLOCK: Not ‘about.’ Exactly a pint. That was their first mistake. The blood’s definitely 
Ian Monkford’s but it’s been frozen. 
LESTRADE: Frozen? 
SHERLOCK: There are clear signs. I think Ian Monkford gave a pint of his blood some time 
ago and that’s what they spread on the seats. 
JOHN: Who did? 
SHERLOCK: Janus Cars. The clue’s in the name. 
JOHN: The god with two faces.
