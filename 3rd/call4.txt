SHERLOCK: Hello? 
(The frightened voice of a young man comes over the phone.) 
YOUNG MAN: It’s okay that you’ve gone to the police. 
SHERLOCK: Who is this? Is this you again? 
YOUNG MAN: But don’t rely on them. 
(In Lestrade’s office, John looks round and sits up taller when he sees the look on Sherlock’s face.) 
YOUNG MAN: Clever you, guessing about Carl Powers. 
(the young man standing somewhere in a busy street, reading from a pager.) 
YOUNG MAN: I never liked him. 
(Sherlock looks round sharply at this. man is wearing a zipped-up jacket with wires 
sticking out from the bottom. The man fights his tears as he continues to read.) 
YOUNG MAN: Carl laughed at me, so I stopped him laughing.
