SHERLOCK: Mr Ewert of Janus Cars had a twenty thousand Colombian peso note in his wallet ... 
(Flashback to Ewert opening his wallet and Sherlock seeing the foreign note inside.) 
SHERLOCK: ... Quite a bit of change, too. He told us he hadn’t been abroad recently, but when 
I asked him about the cars, I could see his tan line clearly. 
(Flashback to Sherlock pointing out the window and Ewert turning his head to look while 
Sherlock sees that his tan finishes at his neck.) 
SHERLOCK: No-one wears a shirt on a sunbed. That, plus his arm. 
LESTRADE: His arm? 
SHERLOCK: Kept scratching it. Obviously irritating him, and bleeding. 
(Flashback to a close-up of Ewert scratching his upper arm, and a drop of blood on his shirt sleeve.) 
SHERLOCK: Why? Because he’d recently had a booster jab. Hep-B, probably. Difficult to tell at that 
distance. Conclusion: he’d just come back from settling Ian Monkford into his new life in Colombia. 
Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance and she splits it with Janus Cars. 
JOHN: M-Mrs Monkford? 
SHERLOCK: Oh yes. She’s in on it too.
