 He picks up the phone and answers it. 
SHERLOCK: Hello? 
YOUNG MAN (tearfully reading from the pager): The clue’s in the name. Janus Cars. 
SHERLOCK: Why would you be giving me a clue? 
YOUNG MAN: Why does anyone do anything? Because I’m bored. We were made for 
each other, Sherlock. 
SHERLOCK (softly): Then talk to me in your own voice. 
YOUNG MAN (tearfully): Patience. 
(The line goes dead. Sherlock lowers the phone and looks thoughtfully into the distance 
for a while. Finally he looks down at the fizzing liquid in the dish, then picks up the dish
 and looks at it more closely. He begins to smile.) 

THREE HOURS TO GO.
