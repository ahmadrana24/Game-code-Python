Close to the river, the police have arrived at a large open space where the car was 
found. Forensics officers in protective clothing are working on the car as Lestrade 
leads Sherlock towards it. John and Sally Donovan are walking along behind them. 
LESTRADE (consulting some notes): The car was hired yesterday morning by an Ian 
Monkford. Banker of some kind; City boy. Paid in cash. 
(Sherlock looks closely as they pass a woman talking with a female police officer.) 
LESTRADE: Told his wife he was going away on a business trip, but he never arrived.
