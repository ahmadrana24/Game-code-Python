ST BART’S LAB. Sherlock has a large drop of blood in a shallow glass dish. Putting the dish 
onto the desk, he reaches into a small bag of equipment, opens a bottle and siphons out 
some liquid with a small dropper. Bending down to the dish, he squeezes out a drop of 
liquid onto the blood, which starts to fizz. As Sherlock straightens up, the pink phone rings. 
The Caller I.D. reads “BLOCKED”.
