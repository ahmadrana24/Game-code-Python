(John comes out of the office and walks closer to Sherlock, looking at him in concern.) 
SHERLOCK (into phone): And you’ve stolen another voice, I presume. 
YOUNG MAN: This is about you and me. 
(A bus noisily drives past him.) 
SHERLOCK: Who are you? 
(More traffic goes past.) 
SHERLOCK: What’s that noise? 
(The man looks down at the pager, still struggling not to weep.) 
YOUNG MAN: The sounds of life, Sherlock. 
( He is standing on a large traffic island at Piccadilly Circus. Pedestrians are walking past him, taking no 
notice of a distressed tearful man, as is the wont of Londoners [I’m allowed to criticise – I’m a Londoner myself!]) 
YOUNG MAN (reading from the pager): But don’t worry ... 
(He looks down in tearful horror when he sees a red laser point on his jacket.) 
YOUNG MAN: ... I can soon fix that. 
(He cries briefly, then continues to read the pager message.) 
YOUNG MAN: You solved my last puzzle in nine hours. This time you have eight.
