Several police cars race to a disused factory and the police officers, 
together with Sherlock and John, run inside the dark building. 
Everyone switches on flashlights and Sally coordinates the police as
they start to search in all directions
LESTRADE (softly): Look in there. Quietly. Quietly. 
SHERLOCK: They’re still here
DONOVAN (calling out): Over here! 
(Everyone runs in the direction of her voice. Sally and other officers
reach down to the children.)
they all rescue the kids and take them to the police station.....
