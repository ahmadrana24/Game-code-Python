JOHN (on phone): Hello? 
SHERLOCK: John. 
JOHN: Hey, Sherlock, you okay? 
SHERLOCK: Turn around and walk back the way you came now. 
JOHN: No, I’m coming in. 
SHERLOCK: Okay, look up. I’m on the rooftop. 
(John turns and looks up, his face filling with horror.) 
JOHN: Oh God. 
SHERLOCK: I ... I ... I can’t come down, so we’ll ... we’ll just have to do it like this. 
JOHN (anxiously): What’s going on?
