Sherlock goes over to a wooden trunk and opens the lid.
Amongst the other items inside the trunk he finds a large
brown envelope with a wax seal on the back which has already
been broken as if someone has opened the envelope. Inside is 
a large hardback book. Carefully checking the envelope first, he 
then takes out the book and flips it over to look at the cover. The
book is “Grimm’s Fairy Tales.” He looks along the edges of the book and then 
riffles the pages quickly. Finding nothing of interest, he looks up.
