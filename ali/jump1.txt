Sherlock starts walking  on the roof as if he's sesrching something
then he comes near Jim and starts talking to him...
Jim Moriarty – now back in a typical smart suit and overcoat 
JIM: Ah. Here we are at last – you and me, Sherlock,
Sherlock: Yes I know...and i know the code as well which you used to break in everywhere...
Jim: there was no such code...
i fooled you....
I bribed those people on the security to break-in there is no such code..
