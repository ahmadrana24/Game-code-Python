sherlock gets angry and punches moriarty in his face
so hard that he starts to bleed
but Jim doesn't make a move...
sherlock again punches him in his lower 
Jim teases sherlock so much and constantly asks sherlock 
to jump of the building...
Sherlock shoves him further back, now holding him over the edge. Jim whoops almost 
triumphantly and gazes back at him with no fear in his eyes, holding his hands out 
wide and committing himself to Sherlock’s grasp

Sherlock(holding jim from his collar): You're insane im gonna throw you down...
Jim: wo wo wo.....Ok let me give you an extra incentive
your friends will die if you don't and i mean everyone...
