The little girl is sitting at a table looking down into her lap. 
A female liaison officer is sitting beside her stroking her arm reassuringly.
SHERLOCK: Claudette, I ... 
(He gets no further because the girl lifts her head, takes one look at him 
and begins to scream in terror.) 
SHERLOCK: No-no, I know it’s been hard for you ... 
(She continues screaming and scrambles to get away while pointing at him.) 
SHERLOCK: Claudette, listen to me ... 
LESTRADE: Out. Get out! 
(Grabbing his arm, he bundles Sherlock out of the room as the girl’s screams continue.)
