LESTRADE: Miss Mackenzie, House Mistress. Go easy.  
SHERLOCK: Miss Mackenzie, you’re in charge of pupil welfare, yet you left this place wide open last night. 
(His voice rises angrily.) What are you: an idiot, a drunk or a criminal? 
MISS MACKENZIE: All the doors and windows were properly bolted. No-one – not even me – went into
 their room last night. You have to believe me! 
SHERLOCK: I do. I just wanted you to speak quickly.
