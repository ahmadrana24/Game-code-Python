(Jim nods and smiles ecstatically.) 
JIM: You’ve gotta admit that’s sexier. 
(Sherlock slowly steps past him and up onto the ledge.) 
JIM: I told you how this ends. 
(Sherlock’s breathing becomes more shaky as he looks down.) 
JIM (not even looking at him): Your death is the only thing that’s gonna call off the killers. I’m certainly not gonna do it. 
(Now he turns his head and looks up at his enemy expectantly. Sherlock blinks anxiously.) 
SHERLOCK: Would you give me ... one moment, please; one moment of privacy? 
(He glances down at Jim.) 
SHERLOCK: Please? 
(Jim looks disappointed that Sherlock should be so ‘ordinary.’) 
JIM: Of course.
