SHERLOCK: This phone call – it’s, er ... it’s my note. It’s what people do, don’t they – leave a note? 
JOHN: Leave a note when? 
SHERLOCK: Goodbye, John. 
JOHN (shaking his head): No. Don’t. 
(Sherlock gazes down at his friend for several seconds, then he lowers his arm and drops the 
phone onto the roof, gazing ahead of himself. John lowers his own phone and screams upwards.) 
JOHN: No. SHERLOCK! 
(Sherlock spreads his arms to either side and falls forward, plummeting towards the ground. 
John stares in utter horror.) 
JOHN: Sher... 
(A couple of seconds later the body impacts the ground. John’s hearing whites out as his entire 
body focuses on getting to Sherlock as soon as he can. Sherlock had disappeared from view towards 
the end of his fall because a building was in the way of John’s view of him)
