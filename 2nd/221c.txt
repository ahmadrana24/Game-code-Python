BAKER STREET. A taxi pulls up outside 221 and Sherlock, John and Lestrade get out. Sherlock unlocks the front 
door and leads the way inside, bypassing the stairs and heading along the corridor towards Mrs Hudson’s front 
door. Just as he reaches it he stops and turns to the left where there is another door which must lead to a basement 
flat. Numbers and letters stuck on the door read, “221c”. They enter the room and there is a pair of SHOES on the 
floor.
