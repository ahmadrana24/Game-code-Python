You go out in Bakers street and take a cab to go to the police station. The boys arrive at New Scotland Yard and are 
following Detective Inspector Lestrade across the general office towards his office. 
LESTRADE: You like the funny cases, don’t you? The surprising ones. 
SHERLOCK: Obviously. 
LESTRADE: You’ll love this. That explosion ... 
SHERLOCK (briefly exchanging glares with Detective Sergeant Donovan as he walks past her desk): Gas leak, yes? 
LESTRADE: No. 
SHERLOCK: No? 
LESTRADE: No. Made to look like one. 
JOHN: What? 
(By now they’re in Lestrade’s office and Sherlock stops and stares down at a white envelope lying on a desk.)
LESTRADE: Hardly anything left of the place except a strong box – a very strong box – and inside it was this. 
(He points to what Sherlock’s looking at.) 
SHERLOCK: You haven’t opened it? 
LESTRADE: It’s addressed to you, isn’t it?
