He pauses for a second, then switches on the speaker, holding the phone a few inches in front of his mouth.) 
SHERLOCK (softly): Hello? 
(A female voice draws in a shaky breath before speaking tearfully.) 
WOMAN’s VOICE: H-hello ... 
(John and Lestrade exchange a puzzled look as the woman sobs.) 
SHERLOCK: Who’s this? 
WOMAN’s VOICE (tearfully): I’ve ... sent you ... a little puzzle ... just to say hi. 
SHERLOCK: Who’s talking? Why are you crying? 
WOMAN’s VOICE (shakily and full of tears): I-I’m not ... crying ... I’m typing ... 
(The woman at the other end of the line is sitting in the driver’s seat of a car holding a phone to her ear 
with one shaking hand and holding a pager in the other hand. Her face is covered with tears and she 
looks terrified as she reads from the pager.) 
WOMAN: ... and this ... stupid ... bitch ... is reading it out. 
(She sobs again. Sherlock gazes thoughtfully into the distance.) 
SHERLOCK (softly): The curtain rises. 
JOHN: What? 
SHERLOCK: Nothing. 
JOHN: No, what did you mean? 
SHERLOCK (half turning his head towards him): I’ve been expecting this for some time. 
WOMAN: Twelve hours to solve ... my puzzle, Sherlock ... 
(the car is in a car park. People are going about their everyday business, unaware that a large 
explosive device is strapped to the woman’s chest. A red laser point travels over the device and her neck, suggesting 
that a sniper is aiming at her from some distance away.) 
WOMAN: ... or I’m going ... to be ... so naughty. 
(The phone goes dead and the woman looks down at the bomb and the laser light, and sobs in despair.)
