(You take the shoes to the Lab and with Dr. Watson you deduce there that :)
The owner loved these. Scrubbed them clean, whitened them where they got discoloured. Changed 
the laces three ... no, four times. 
(John puts his hands on the desk and lowers his head in despair.) 
SHERLOCK: Even so, there are traces of his flaky skin where his fingers have come into contact with them, 
so he suffered from eczema. Shoes are well-worn, more so on the inside, which means the owner had 
weak arches. British-made, twenty years old. 
JOHN (straightening up): Twenty years? 
SHERLOCK: They’re not retro – they’re original. 
(He shows John an image on his phone.) 
SHERLOCK: Limited edition: two blue stripes, nineteen eighty-nine. 
JOHN: But there’s still mud on them. They look new. 
SHERLOCK (looking thoughtfully at the trainer): Someone’s kept them that way. Quite a bit of mud caked on the 
soles. Analysis shows it’s from Sussex, with London mud overlaying it. 
JOHN: How do you know? 
SHERLOCK (nodding towards the computer screen): Pollen. Clear as a map reference to me. 
(Two dots are flashing on a map of Britain, one around the borders of East and West Sussex and the other to the 
south-east of London.) 
SHERLOCK: South of the river, too. So, the kid who owned these trainers came to London from Sussex twenty 
years ago and left them behind. 
JOHN: So what happened to him? 
SHERLOCK: Something bad. 
(He looks up at John.) 
SHERLOCK: He loved those shoes, remember. He’d never leave them filthy. Wouldn’t leave them go unless he 
had to. So: a child with big feet gets ... 
(He trails off, staring ahead of himself.) 
SHERLOCK (softly): Oh. 
(John looks across the lab, trying to see what his friend is looking at.) 
JOHN: What? 
SHERLOCK (softly): Carl Powers.
