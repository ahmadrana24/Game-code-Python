SHERLOCK: Clostridium botulinum! 
(Mrs Hudson cringes and flees the kitchen. Sherlock looks round at John as he comes in from the living room.) 
SHERLOCK: It’s one of the deadliest poisons on the planet! 
(John looks at him blankly.) 
SHERLOCK: Carl Powers! 
JOHN: Oh, wait, are you saying he was murdered? 
(Sherlock stands up and walks over to where he has hung up the laces from the trainers.) 
SHERLOCK: Remember the shoelaces? 
JOHN: Mmm. 
SHERLOCK: The boy suffered from eczema. It’d be the easiest thing in the world to introduce the poison 
into his medication. Two hours later he comes up to London, the poison takes effect, paralyses the muscles 
and he drowns. 
JOHN: What – how-how come the autopsy didn’t pick that up? 
SHERLOCK: It’s virtually undetectable. Nobody would have been looking for it.
