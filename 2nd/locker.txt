(While searching in the locker) 
SHERLOCK: Nineteen eighty-nine, a young kid – champion swimmer – came up from Brighton for a 
school sports tournament; drowned in the pool. Tragic accident. The boy, Carl Powers, had some kind 
of fit in the water, but by the time they got him out  it was too late. But there was something wrong; 
something I couldn’t get out of my head. 
SHERLOCK: His shoes. 
JOHN: What about them? 
SHERLOCK: They aren’t here. I made a fuss; I tried to get the police interested, but nobody seemed to 
think it was important. He’d left all the rest of his clothes in his locker, but there was no sign of his shoes ... 
(He leans down and picks up a bag containing the trainers.) 
SHERLOCK: ... until now.  

SIX HOURS TO GO. As Sherlock sits in the back of the taxi holding the pink phone and lost in thought, the woman
 who rang him earlier sits in her car crying in despair. 

Now you are at 221B and trying to solve the puzzle with Watson and thinking what could be the death reason
of Carl powers ?
